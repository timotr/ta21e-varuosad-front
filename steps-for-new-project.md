I'm making a Git repo
I add SSH keys (per repo or user)
git clone in the project folder, not randomly on the desktop
I'm looking for boilerplate or manually making metadata files
I install the necessary packages for the backend
I document what packages I chose for what
I document what the point of this project is, for whom, etc
I prepare the dev env startup commands and config files
I document how to set up the project and how to start it
I'm testing whether hello world comes up.
I install the frontend framework, test whether hello world comes up
Commit and push both projects, message "Project init"
